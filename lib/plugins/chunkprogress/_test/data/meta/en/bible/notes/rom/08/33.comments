According to the list of terms, <strong>Intercede</strong> is listed as a term having a definition.  In the text Christ intercedes for believers.  However when one goes to the “Complete list of important terms” and looks up the word “intercedes” it is there but there is nothing in the definition!

**God is the one who justifies** - Could be translated as a rhetorical question: “God? The one who justifies?”
    
**Is it Christ Jesus,** - Or rhetorically as “Christ Jesus?”
    
**the one who died,** - Could be rhetorical: “The one who died?”
    
**and who even more importantly was raised from the dead, …** - Making it rhetorical, it could be ”–who, even more importantly, was raised from the dead, …”

We want to turn rhetorical questions into statements, not vice versa.
