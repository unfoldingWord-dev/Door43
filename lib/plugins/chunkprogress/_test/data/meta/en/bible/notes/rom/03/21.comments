Here are your notes before I did anything.

**For there is no distinction **- This could be translated as "For there is no difference between Jews and non-Jews".

Let me know if you have any questions about what I did.";s:5:"xhtml";s:575:"

**Now** I'm trying to explain that this word refers to a time period not "right this second."

**witnessed by the Law and prophets** this is the phrase we discussed earlier.

**righteousness** can you think of a better way of expressing this idea?";s:5:"xhtml";s:360:"
