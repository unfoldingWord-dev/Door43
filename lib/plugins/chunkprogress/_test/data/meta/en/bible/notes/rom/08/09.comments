Your notes before I did anything:

**Spirit of Christ**  –Paul is using this phrase as a synonym for "Spirit of God" or "Holy Spirit." But since Paul says "Spirit of Christ," it seems he is also implying the doctrine of the Trinity.

**in the flesh**  –This describes what we were before we became believers in Jesus, living according to our sinful nature.

These notes were out of order. Notes need to follow the order of the ULB. "in the flesh" comes before "Spirit of Christ" in the text.";s:5:"xhtml";s:611:"

I removed the portion about the Trinity because I thought it may be commentary rather than a translation note.

**the body is dead in respect to sin** - Possible meanings are 1) a person is spiritually dead to the power of sin or 2) the physical body will still die because of sin.
**the spirit is alive in respect to righteousness** - Possible meanings are 1) a person is spiritually alive God has given him power to do what is right or 2) God will bring the person back to life after he dies because God is righteous and gives believers eternal life.

UPDATE

But, look at the next chunk which seems to make clear this is referring to physical resurrection

Looking at UDB, commentaries, and English translations it seems there is a divide as to whether this refers to spiritual death and life now, or physical death and resurrection in the future. I put both as options.";s:5:"xhtml";s:861:"
