Your notes:

**But I say** - The pronoun “I” in 10:18 refers to Paul.
    
**Did they not hear** - The pronoun “they” in 10:18 refers to the Israelites.
    
**But I say, “Did they not hear?” Yes, most certainly.** - Paul asks this question to emphasize that the Israelites have heard the good news of Christ. (See: Rhetorical Question) Alternate translation: “But I ask, didn't the Israelites hear? Of course they did.”
    
**Their sound has gone out into all the earth And their words to the ends of the world** - This is a quote from scripture which says that people can know that there is a God just by looking at the heavens.

**Their sound has gone out into all the earth And their words to the ends of the world**

Susan and I are discussing "doublets" and "parallels" in Isaiah. From our discussions I think this is better labeled "parallel." I could have added "metonymy" to the list but I thought that may be a bit much.

As for the purpose of this quote, the OT is talking about the testimony of nature to the Gentiles, but I think Paul is using this verse to talk specifically about missionaries and the message of Christ. I think the flow of thought is this: How do I know the Jews have heard about Christ. Just like in the OT the general revelation given by nature to the Gentiles showed the nations had an understanding of what was already told to the Jews through special revelation, likewise the fact the missionaries are going through the nations shows that the message of Christ started with the Jews then moved outward.

If Paul is using this quote to only refer to nature's general revelation I don't think it makes any sense in his argument. In 10:15 he just said someone has to be sent for them to hear the message.

I didn't want to introduce this idea into the notes since the UDB does not, but I think it should be considered.
