<strong>Verse 10 - UDB - And for those who state publicly that Jesus is Lord—God will save them.</strong> We question the use of the word “publicly” in this version. It sounds like you must make a “public” confession of faith in order to be saved.

Your notes:

**But what does it say?** - “But what does the scripture say?” Paul wants to emphasize that the scripture answers their question. (See: Rhetorical Question)

Need to translate as a statement.
    
**word** - The term “word” in verse 8 refers to an entire message, not just one word.
    
**Lord** - The word “lord” means someone who has ownership or authority over people. God is the ultimate authority who created everything and rules over everything.

This is covered on KT page.
    
**For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation**. - “For if a person believes on Jesus, God will make them right with himself and they will say that Jesus is their Lord because they have been saved.”
