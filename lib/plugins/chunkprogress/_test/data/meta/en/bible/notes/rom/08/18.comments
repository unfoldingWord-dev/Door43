Your notes

**I consider that** - This could be translated as “I calculate that” or “I estimate that.”
    
I removed because I think these words are more difficult than "consider" or "think" (UDB)

**are not worthy to be compared with** - An alternate translation might be “cannot even compare to” or “are not worth comparing with.”
    
**will be revealed** - Other ways to translate this might be “will be made known” or “will be disclosed” or “will be shown clearly.”
    
**the eager expectation of the creation waits for** - An alternate wording could be “the intense anticipation of the creation eagerly waits for” or “with eager expectation the creation looks forward to.”

I just gave an explanation instead of translation alternative because I think the UDB is clear.
