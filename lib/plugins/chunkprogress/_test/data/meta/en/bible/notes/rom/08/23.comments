1. Replacing "And" with "But this is" blurs the sense of the English sentence.  I suggest "And not only that, but..." or, more explicitly, "And not creation only, but...."

2. In English, it is grammatically incorrect to use a reflexive pronoun without its antecedent.  I realize that the ULB is already very literal, but let me suggest the following which would be almost as literal, but using good English:

"And not only the creation, but we also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, that is, the redemption of our body."

Your notes:

**confidence … confident** - Make these consistent with the way you translate “confidence” in Romans 8:20.
