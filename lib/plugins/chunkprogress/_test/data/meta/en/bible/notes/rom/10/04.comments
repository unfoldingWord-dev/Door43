<strong>Verse 5 - UDB - “It is the people who have done perfectly the things that the Law requires who will live forever.”</strong> - No where in the Greek text does it have the term or concept of “live forever.” It says they will “live by this righteousness.”

Your notes:

**for righteousness for every one who believes** - “to make righteous everyone who believes in him” (To “believe in Jesus” means to believe that he is the Son of God, that he is God himself who also became human and who died as a sacrifice to pay for our sins. It means to trust him as Savior and live in a way that honors him.)
    
**Moses** - See: How to Translate Names

I only make this note if the name is not a key term.
    
**The man who does the righteousness of the Law will live by this righteousness.** - “The man who does the righteousness of the law must continue to live by this standard.”
