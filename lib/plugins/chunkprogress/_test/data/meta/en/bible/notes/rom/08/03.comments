I struggled with this one. I was not sure how to explain that the Law was weak or was the one that failed, when what it means is that we were weak and failed to keep the law.

I have "God was able," but the verb that goes with "God" is "condemned." I didn't know how to show this without rewriting the whole verse.

"Condemned in the flesh." I think the UDB is off on its translation. "When he did this, he also showed that our sins are truly wicked, and that anyone who sins deserves to be punished." I think this is missing the point. The Law already told everyone that sin deserved to be punished. I think this phrase means sin itself was judged, condemned, and broken in the body of Christ (i.e. in his flesh). We didn't need to be told sin was bad, we needed someone to help us stop sinning.";s:5:"xhtml";s:891:"

Your notes

**likeness of sinful flesh** - When Jesus was on earth, he looked like any other man (“likeness of”). But he did not have the sinful nature (“sinful flesh”) that we have.
    
**in the flesh** - The word “flesh” refers to the human nature apart from God. By making his Son an offering for our sin, God condemned the sin of the sinful nature.
    
**according to the flesh** - This is similar to “in the flesh,” but it refers to the way of life of people who do not know God, who make selfish decisions and wrong choices, who do not obey God's commands. (Verse 5 explains what it means to live “according to the flesh.”)
    
**according to the Spirit** - This is the opposite of “according to the flesh.” It refers a believer in Christ who is obedient to the Spirit of God and God's laws. (Verse 5 clarifies what it means to live “according to the Spirit.”)
