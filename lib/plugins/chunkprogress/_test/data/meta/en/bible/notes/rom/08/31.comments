I was about to define the pronoun in "delivered him up on behalf of us all" but quickly saw it could get tricky. Is it "all of humanity" or "all of those he foreknew"?

In context I think it is the latter, but that could be controversial. I left vague. 

I also thought about defining "all things." This does not mean all the riches in the world (prosperity Gospel). But, it is also more than spiritual blessings because one day God will give believers the whole world. So, I wasn't sure how to word it.
