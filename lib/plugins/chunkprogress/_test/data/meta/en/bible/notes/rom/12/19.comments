**Vengeance belongs to me, "I will repay" - **"Allow God to punish those who do evil to you." (UDB) The purpose of the doublet is to emphasize that God will judge and punish those who choose to do evil to God's people. An alternation translation is God has said that he will absolutely punish those who do evil to his people. (See Doublet)

**feed him **- "provide him with food to eat"

**give him a drink**  - "provide him with something to drink"

**heap coals of fire on his head**  - Preferred meaning 1) "make the person who persecuted you feel badly about how he has mistreated you. Or other possible meaning is 2) "give God a reason to judge your persecutor more harshly." These words have a different meaning as a group than they do as individual words. (See Idiom)

**Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good - **  Do not let evil defeat you, but defeat evil by doing good instead. Paul presents evil as though it is a living being. (See: Personification)";s:5:"xhtml";s:1172:"
