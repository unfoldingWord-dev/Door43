**For the Scriptures say,** - See: Personification
    
**Greek** - When used in this way to refer to someone who is not a Jew, other ways to translate “Greek” would be, “Gentile” or “non-Jew.”
    
**and is rich to all who call upon him** - “and he richly blesses all who call on him”
    
**the name of the Lord** - In this phrase, “the name” represents the entire person of the Lord Jesus Christ, not just his name. (See: Metonymy)
