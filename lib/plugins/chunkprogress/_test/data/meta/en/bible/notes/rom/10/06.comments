Also, I struggled with wording the rhetorical question. Should it be "Someone must" or "No one can"?

It may not make a big difference either way.";s:5:"xhtml";s:410:"

**But the righteousness that comes from faith says this** - “But the person who has been made righteous by faith in Christ says” Paul uses the concept of righteousness as if it were a person who is righteous that is asking a question. (See: Personification)
    
**“Do not say in your heart** - “Do not ask yourself”
    
**'Who will ascend into heaven?'…'Who will descend into the abyss?'** - (See: Rhetorical Question)
    
**(that is, to bring Christ down)** - ”(in order that they bring Christ down)”
    
**(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)** - ”(in order that they bring Christ up from the dead)”
