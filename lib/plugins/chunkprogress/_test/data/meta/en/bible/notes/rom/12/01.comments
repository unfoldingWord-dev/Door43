Your notes

**therefore** - This teaching is based on the teaching in the previous section about how God is merciful.
    
**present your bodies a living sacrifice** - “offer your bodies as if they were a sacrifice on a temple altar” (See: Metaphor)
    
**living sacrifice** - A sacrifice was normally an animal that the worshiper killed and burned. In this case the Christian offers himself to God as a sacrifice that continues to live and serve God. (See: Oxymoron).
    
**holy and acceptable to God** - The Christian should be morally pure and therefore a person that God approves. (See: Doublet)
    
**spiritual service** - Possible meanings are 1) “worship that takes place in the believer's spirit” or 2) “worship that is the reasonable or fitting type”.
    
**be transformed** - “let God transform you” (See: Active/Passive)
