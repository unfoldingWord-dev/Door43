<strong>“God knew previously that we would believe in him.”</strong>(UDB 8:29) I am not sure that this is what Paul was saying here.  It looks like to me that the translator of the UDB is taking sides on the Predestine-Freewill debate. I think that it is better to translate it as the ULB does.

Your notes:

I added lots of words to kt list. Keep an eye out for these. They will save you time in the long run.

**those whom he foreknew** - Can be worded as, “those whom he knew in advance” or “those whom he foreordained.”
    
**predestined** - Or “determined beforehand” or “predetermined” or “decided in advance.”
    
**to be conformed to the image of his Son** - Or “to become shaped like the character of his Son.”
    
**that he might be the firstborn** - Or “so that Jesus would be the firstborn.” (Every other time “he” occurs in this section, it refers to God.)
    
**he also predestined … whom he predestined** - The translation for “predestined” should be consistent in these two places.
    
**he also called … whom he called** - Or “summoned.” The translation for “called” should be consistent in these two places.
    
**he also justified … whom he justified** - The translation for “justified” should be consistent in these two places.

These kinds of notes are helpful if the words are used in different chunks. If they are in the same chunk I assume the translator will be consistent.
    
**glorified** - Most occurrences in the Bible of “glory” or “glorify” are speaking of the splendors of God or the need for humans to ascribe honor and glory to God. But here, in this context, it speaks of believers being “glorified” as the climax of everything else mentioned in this sequence of God's actions.

I took this out for now. We will see if this definition gets added to the kt page.

This is a tough one. I did my best to stick to the text and not read in any specific theology. 

There is a kt page for "destiny." There is no info on it but I linked "predestination" to it for now.

Read the discussion below about UDB possibly leaning towards one theology. Also, we may need to add to KT page what it means for God to glorify humans.";s:5:"xhtml";s:424:"
