Your notes:

**How then can they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher? And how can they preach, unless they are sent?** - Paul uses rhetorical questions to emphasize the importance of taking the good news of Christ to those who have not heard. (See: Rhetorical Question)
    
**How then can they call on him…And how can they believe in him** - The pronoun “they” in 10:14 refers to unbelievers, people who have not put their faith in Jesus Christ as personal lord and savior.
    
**And how can they preach, unless they are sent?** - The pronoun “they” in 10:15 refers to believers, people who have put their faith in Jesus Christ as personal lord and savior.
    
**unless they are sent** - “unless God sends them” (See: Active)
    
**“How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim glad tidings of good things!”** - “How beautiful are the people who proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ.” Paul uses the feet to represent the entire person. (See: Synecdoche)

 “How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim glad tidings of good things!” - Paul uses “feet” to represent those who travel and bring the message to those who have not heard it. Alternate translation: “It is wonderful when messengers come and tell us the good news.” (See: Synecdoche)

The TFT labels as metonymy which I suppose refers to "the arrival." I lean towards synecdoche but I'm not sure. ";s:5:"xhtml";s:481:"
