Your notes

**bears witness** - This is an English idiom which means to provide evidence, or give the facts, about something. (See: witness.)
    
I took out. I think kt term is sufficient.

**heirs of God on the one hand, and joint heirs on the other hand with Christ** - The phrases “on the one hand” and “on the other hand” introduce two different ways of thinking about something. Alternate translation: “heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.” (See: Idiom)
