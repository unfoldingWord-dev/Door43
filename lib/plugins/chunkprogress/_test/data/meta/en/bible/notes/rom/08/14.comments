See Tim's discussion below. I agree that "sons of God" page should have an explanation what it means for a human to be a son of God rather than just a translation alternative. Ward left some comments on the kt page.

I also altered their note about "spirit." They suggested it means "mindset" in regards to "bondage." I think it is actually talking about the Holy Spirit in regards to what he does and does not do. Just as we say something like

"I did not give you a car that would break down, I gave you a car that will drive across the country."

In both cases it is referring to the same car. First it describes it in a negative sense (which we could label as litotes) and then in a positive sense.

But, take a look at their discussion and see what you think.";s:5:"xhtml";s:872:"

Consider adding the definition of "sons of God" given by the TN here to the KT page for "sons of God." We can delete the note here if the definition on the KT page is clear enough.

Otherwise we might as well delete the link from the Important Terms pane.
