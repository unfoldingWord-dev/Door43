Your notes

**Bless** - For example, to pray that God will do something good for them.
    
**those** - Those refers to anyone. Here it refers probably to non-Christians persecuting Christians.
    
**you** - This means bless anyone who persecutes you.
    
**curse** - A curse can be a statement that harm will happen to someone or something.
    
**Rejoice with those who rejoice** - Alternate translation: “Spend time with happy people and be happy along with them”
    
**weep with those who weep** - Alternate translation: “spend time with sad people and be sad along with them”
    
**Be of the same mind toward one another** - Alternate translation: “Live in unity with all other Christians.”
    
**Do not think in proud ways** - Alternate translation : “Do not think that you are more important than others.”
    
**lowly** - “Be friends with people who seem unimportant.” (UDB)
    
**wise** - Do not think that you know everything and can not learn new things.

Try to avoid one word entries. Give a little context. Also, you need to have in the bold part everything you cover in the explanation or translation suggestion. These last two entries does not have the full phrase in bold that you deal with in the section on the right.
