**UDB when we feel weak and discouraged**

I don't think this captures the idea. It is not about when the Spirit helps us because we are down emotionally. Here it means he helps us in a specific place where humans are weak, namely, prayer. We are weak in prayer because we do not fully know the will of God so we don't know what to pray.

I suggest "where we are weak"";s:5:"xhtml";s:456:"

Your notes

**He who searches the hearts** - This refers to God.

This is a good note but it is out of order.

**inexpressible groanings** - An alternate translation might be “groanings too deep to put into words” or “groanings too profound to be expressed by words.”

I changed this because "deep" is a figurative word and "profound" may be too difficult. I used what the UDB had but put into active voice.";s:5:"xhtml";s:528:"
