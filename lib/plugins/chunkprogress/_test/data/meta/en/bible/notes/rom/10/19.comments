See David's comment below.

I think what is making this difficult is Paul is advancing the meaning of these OT passages. In the OT context they mean one thing but Paul is using them for a different purpose. In Deuteronomy that is a judgment passage and it sounds more like the "not a nation" will conquer Israel, perhaps pointing to Babylonian army. But, Paul is using it to refer to God's salvation going to the Gentiles. 

I suppose my issue is that here the UDB translated Paul's meaning, but in the last chunk the UDB translates the original OT meaning.


On a different topic: do you think it will be confusing when it says "Moses says" but in the quote "I" refers to God?
