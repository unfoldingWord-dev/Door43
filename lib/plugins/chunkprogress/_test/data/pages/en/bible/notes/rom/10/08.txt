\v 8 But instead, those who believe in Christ can say what Moses wrote: “You can find out about God's message very easily. You can speak about it and think about it." This is the message that we proclaim: that people must believe in Christ.
\v 9  This message is that if anyone of you confirms that Jesus is Lord, and if you truly believe that God raised him from the dead, he will save you.
\v 10 If people believe these things, God will put them right with himself. And for those who state publicly that Jesus is Lord—God will save them.

\v 8 But what does it say? 
\q "The word is near you, 
\q in your mouth and in your heart."
\p
That is the word of faith, which we proclaim.
\v 9 For if you acknowledge with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
\v 10 For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **But what does it say?**  - The word "it" refers to "righteousness" in 10:6. Here Paul describes "righteousness" as a person that can speak. Paul uses a question to emphasize the answer he is about to give. Alternate translation: "But this is what Moses says" (See: [[en:ta:translate:personification]] and [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **The word is near you**  - "The message is right here"
    * **in your mouth** - The word "mouth" refers to what a person speaks. This can be translated as a new sentence: "It is in what you say." (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy]]) 
    * **and in your heart** - The word "heart" refers to a person's mind or what he thinks. Alternate translation: "and it is in what you think."
    * **if you acknowledge with your mouth Jesus as Lord** - "if you confess that Jesus is Lord"
    * **believe in your heart** - "accept as true"
    * **you will be saved** - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will save you." (See: [[en:ta:translate:active]])
    * **For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation** - "For it is with the mind that a person trusts and is right before God, and it is with the mouth that a person confesses and God saves him"
