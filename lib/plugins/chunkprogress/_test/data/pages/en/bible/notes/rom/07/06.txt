So we serve God, not by \add having to obey\add* those rituals, which is the old way, but in the new way, as \add God's\add* Spirit \add helps us to serve him\add*.

\v 6 But now God has freed us from having to obey Law of Moses—it is as though we have died, and the Law can no longer tell us what to do. God has done this for us so that we may worship him in a new way that the Spirit shows us, rather than in the old way that the Law required.
