===== Translation Notes: =====

 Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, answering the questions such a person might have.

    * **What then? Do we excuse ourselves?** - Possible meanings are: 1) "We Christians are not trying to hide the wicked things that we are supposedly doing!" or 2) "We Jews should not try to imagine we are going to escape God's judgment, just because we are Jewish!" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:translate:Rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **Not at all** - These words are stronger than a simple "no," but not as strong as "absolutely not!"
