====== Romans 07:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 \add My desire to\add* sin found a way \f + \ft personification \f* to deceive me \add by making me think wrongly that\add* I could keep \add on sinning and at the same time obey\add* those laws \add enough so that I would live eternally\add*, and \add thus it\add* caused me to be separated from God \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 12 So \add we conclude that\add* the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* are holy. What God commanded \add about not coveting, along with all the other things that he commanded\add*, is also holy, and it is just and good.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 When I wanted to sin, I thought that I would live forever if I obeyed the Law enough. But I was mistaken: I thought I could keep sinning at the same time. In fact, God was going to separate me from him forever because I did not truly obey the Law.
\v 12 So we know that the Law that God gave to Moses is perfectly good. Everything that God commands us to do is also holy, just, and good.

\v 11 For sin, taking the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment it killed me.
\v 12 Therefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy, righteous, and good.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sin, taking the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment it killed me.** - As in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:07:07|7:7-8]], Paul is describing sin as a person who can do 3 things: take the opportunity, deceive, and kill. "because I wanted to sin, I deceived myself into thinking that I could sin and obey the commandment at the same time, but God punished me for disobeying the commandment by separating me from him." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification]]) 
  * **sin** - "my desire to sin" (See: [[en:ta:translate:metonymy|]])
  * **taking the opportunity through the commandment** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:07:07|7:8]].
  * **it killed me** - "it separated me from God" (See UDB, [[en:ta:translate:metaphor|]]))
  * **Therefore** - Because the law allows sin to be recognized as a deceiver and killer
