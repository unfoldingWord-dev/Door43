====== Romans 07:19-21 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, it is evil things that I do not want to do that I do.
\v 20 Because I do \add evil things\add* that I do not want to do, it is not that I do \add evil things because I want to\add*. Instead, \add I do them because\add* my self-directed nature, which permeates me \f + \ft personification \f*, \add causes me to do them\add*.
\v 21 I find, then, that what always happens is that when I want to do what is good, there is an evil \add desire\add* present within me that \f + \ft personification \f* \add prevents me from doing good\add*.
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, it is evil things that I do not want to do that I do.
\v 20 When I do evil things that I do not want to do, it is not that really I that do those things. Instead, something else is making me sin: it is the fact that I am imperfect that makes me sin.
\v 21 I find, then, that what always happens is that when I want to do what is good, there is an evil desire present within me that prevents me from doing good.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 For the good that I want I do not do, but the evil that I do not want, that I do.
\v 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, then it is no longer I who am acting, but rather sin that lives in me.
\v 21 I find, then, the principle in me that I want to do what is good, but that evil is actually present in me.
