<usfm>
\v 9 Formerly, when I did not \add know\add* what God's laws \add required\add*, I used to live \add without worrying about what I was doing\add*. But when I \add became aware that God\add* commanded, \add "You must not covet\add*," I suddenly realized \f + \ft personification \f* that I was sinning,
\v 10 and \add I realized that\add* I was separated from God. The laws that \add I thought would enable me to\add* live \add eternally as a result of my obeying them\add* caused me \add to realize that\add* I was separated from God!
</usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 Formerly, when I did not know what God's Law required, I used to sin without worrying about what I was doing. But when I became aware that God had given us his Law, I suddenly realized that I was sinning,
\v 10 and I realized that I was apart from God. The Law that was supposed to allow me to live forever, if I obeyed it, was leading me to die instead.
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 I was alive without the Law once, but when the commandment came, sin regained life and I died.
\v 10 The commandment, which was to bring life, I found to be death.
