\v 26 In the same way, the Spirit also helps in our weakness. For we do not know how we should pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.
\v 27 He who searches the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes in behalf of the saints according to the will of God.
