\v 2 I declare truthfully about them that although they greatly go after God, they do not understand how to go after him in the right way.

\v 1 Brothers, my heart’s desire and my request to God is for them, for their salvation.
\v 2 For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
\v 3 For they do not know of God’s righteousness, and they seek to establish their own righteousness; they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
