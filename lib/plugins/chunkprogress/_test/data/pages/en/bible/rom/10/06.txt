===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **But the righteousness that comes from faith says this**  - Here "righteousness" is described as a person that can speak. Alternate translation: "But Moses writes this about how faith makes a person right before God." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:personification|Personification]])
  * **Do not say in your heart**  - "Do not say to yourself." Moses was addressing the people as though they were one person. (See: [[:en:ta:translate:formsofyou|Forms of 'You']])
  * **Who will ascend into heaven?**  - Moses uses a question to teach his audience. His previous instruction of, "Do not say" requires a negative answer to this question. Alternate translation: "No one should try to go up to heaven." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **that is, to bring Christ down**  - "in order that they might have Christ come down to earth"
  * **Who will descend into the abyss**  - Moses uses a question to teach his audience. His previous instruction of, "Do not say" requires a negative answer to this question. Alternate translation: "No one should try to go down and enter the place where the spirits of dead persons are." (See: [[:en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion|Rhetorical Question]])
  * **that is, to bring Christ up from the dead**  - "in order that they might bring Christ up from the dead"
