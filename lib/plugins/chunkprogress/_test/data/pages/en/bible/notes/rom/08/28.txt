\v 29 God knew previously that we would believe in him.  We are those who God also decided previously would have a character like his Son's character. The result is that Christ is God's firstborn Son, and those who are God's children are the many younger brothers of Jesus.
\v 30 And us who God decided previously that we would be like his Son he also summoned. And us whom he summoned, he also put right with himself. And to us whom he has put right with himself, he also will surely honor us.

\v 28 We know that for those who love God, he works all things together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.
\v 29 Because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
\v 30 Those whom he predestined, these he also called. Those whom he called, these he also justified. Those whom he justified, these he also glorified.
