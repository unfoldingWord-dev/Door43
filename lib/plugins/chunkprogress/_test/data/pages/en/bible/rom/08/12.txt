\v 12 Therefore, my fellow believers, we must live as the Spirit directs us. What we do not have to do is live as our old evil nature wants us to.
\v 13 If you do what your old evil nature wants, you will surely not live forever with God. But if you allow the Spirit to stop you doing those things, then you will live forever.

\v 12 So then, brothers, we are debtors, but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
\v 13 For if you live according to the flesh, you are about to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions, you will live.
