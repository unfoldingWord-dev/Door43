\v 11 Do what I have just told you, especially since you know how important is the time in which we are now living. You know that it is time for you to be fully alert and active, like people who have awakened from sleeping, because the time when Christ will finally deliver us from this world's sin and sorrow is near. That time is closer now than when we first believed in Christ.
\v 12 Our time to live in this world is almost ended, like a night that is nearly ended. The time when Christ will return is near. So we must stop doing the wicked deeds that people like to do at night, and we must be doing the things that will help us resist evil, as soldiers who put on their armor in the daytime get ready to resist their enemies.

\v 11 Because of this, you know the time, that it is already time for you to awake out of sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than we first believed.
\v 12 The night has advanced, and the day has come near. Let us therefore put aside the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
