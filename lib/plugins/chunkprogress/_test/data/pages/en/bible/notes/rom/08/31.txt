\v 31 So I will tell you what we must learn from all these things that God does for us. Because God is acting on our behalf, no one can win against us!
\v 32 God did not spare even his very own Son. Instead, he turned him over to others to cruelly kill him in order that all we who believe in him may benefit from his dying for us. Because God did that, he will also certainly give us freely everything that we need to live for him, in addition to giving us Christ.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?** - Paul uses questions to emphasize the main point of what he said previously. Alternate translation: "This is what we should know from all of this: since God is helping us, no one can defeat us." (See: [[en:ta:translate:rhetoricalquestion]])
    * **but delivered him up** - "but handed him over to his enemies"
    * **how will he not also with him freely give us all things?** - Paul is using a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "he will certainly and freely give us all things."
