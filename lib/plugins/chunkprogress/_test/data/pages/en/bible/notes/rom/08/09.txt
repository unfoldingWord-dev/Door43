\v 9 But we do not have to let our self-directed nature \add control us\add*. Instead, we can \add let\add* God's Spirit \add control us\add*, because he lives within us. If people do not have \add living in them\add* the Spirit \add who comes from\add* Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
\v 10 But since Christ \add is living in you\f + \ft Or: us \f* by his Spirit, although\add* your\f + \ft Or: our \f* bodies \add are certain to\add* die because you\f + \ft Or: we \f* sin, your\f + \ft Or: our \f* spirits are alive because God has erased the record of your\f + \ft Or: our \f* sins.

\v 9 But we do not have to let our old evil nature control us. Instead, we can let God's Spirit control us, because he lives within us. If the Spirit who comes from Christ does not live in people, they do not belong to Christ.
\v 10 But since Christ is living in you by his Spirit, God views your bodies as dead, so you no longer have to sin. And he views your spirits as alive, because he has put you right with himself.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is true that God's Spirit lives in you. But if someone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.
\v 10 If Christ is in you, on the one hand the body is dead in respect to sin, but on the other hand, the spirit is alive in respect to righteousness.
