The hooks in this directory must be correctly copied into your git setup so that pushes to the repositorie(s) will initiate processes in this plugin.

If you are using gitolite you can follow the instructions under **repo-specific hooks** at [gitolite.com](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/non-core.html).
Be sure that `deploy-translation` is fired before `index-translation` otherwise the plugin won't be able to find the necessary files.
